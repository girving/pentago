Usage: http://backend.perfect-pentago.com/<board>

If <board> describes a valid pentago position, compute or lookup the values
of all children of <board> (valid moves starting at <board>) and return the
results as a json dictionary mapping <child> to <value>.  The value of a
position is 1 if the player to move wins, 0 for tie, and -1 for a loss.  The
json dictionary also includes the value of the asked for position, and possibly
some other positions that we computed in the process.

Pentago boards are named by a 64-bit int followed by an optional 'm'; examples
include 0, 1m, 205481007622539795m, etc.  Each quadrant of the pentago boards
gets a 16-bit quarter of the bits, and the stones in a quadrant are packed into
a 9-digit ternary number.  The quadrant order is x-major: the first 16 bits are
lower left, the next 16 bits are upper left, then lower right and upper right.
The 9-digit ternary representation is also x-major order, and each digit is 0
for empty, 1 for black, or 2 for white (by convention, black is the player to
play first).  If there is no 'm', the current player will place a stone next.
If there is an 'm', the current player will rotate a quadrant next.

For example, 205481007622539795m is white (second player) to rotate and win.
Representing black as 1 and white as 2 as in the ternary, this board looks like

  1 2 2 _ _ _
  _ _ 1 _ _ _
  _ _ 2 1 _ 1 
  1 _ 2 2 1 _
  _ _ 2 1 _ _
  _ _ 2 2 _ 1

Internally, values of positions with 18 stones or fewer are looked up in a 4 TB
database.  If there are more stones, the value is computed from scratch using
optimized tree search.  This is computationally expensive, so expect a delay.
