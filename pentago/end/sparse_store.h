// Sparse storage of a bunch of arrays taking advantage of virtual memory
#pragma once

/* I'm afraid of malloc fragmentation.  Storing compressed blocks involves
 * a large number of randomly sized arrays, the total size of which will
 * push up against the total memory in the machine.  Therefore, we use the
 * following trick I got from Eftychis Sifakis:
 *
 * 1. Allocate way more memory than you need via a single, gigantic mmap.
 * 2. Never touch the parts you don't need.
 *
 * As a consequence, we get to use all flat buffers, and everything is simple.
 * The main downside is that our memory usage per block will be the maximum
 * of the size of the compressed partially accumulated arrays.
 *
 * This class is thread safe as long as two threads don't try to write one
 * array at the same time.
