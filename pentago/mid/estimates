The Plan:

Instead of doing forward tree search for boards with 18 or more stones,
we're going to go backwards again.  There are only 18 remaining free stones
on the board, and using a rotation agnostic solve the position of these free
spaces does not change.  The total number of downstream boards starting
at any 18 stone board is only 86,574,831.

If we compute slice by slice as in the full endgame solver, the maximum
number of positions to be stored is
  count(12)+count(11) = 31,855,824 * 64 bytes = 1.9 GB
where for each position we store 64 bits (super_t's for win and not-lose).

Can we decrease the memory requirement by taking advantage of the extreme
structural regularity?  Consider two n stone positions, one with a black stone
in a given position, and one with a white stone in the same position (note
that we're ignoring all rotations).  The descendents of these two positions
are entirely disjoint.  I'm not sure if we can take advantage of this, though.

Consider spot 0, which has value black = 1, white = -1, or empty = 0.  Let
P(n,v) be positions with n stones and value v in spot 0.  The dependencies are

  P(n,0) <- P(n+1,{0,1,-1})
  P(n,v) <- P(n+1,v) # |v| = 1

The following order works

  start with P(n+1,v)
  compute P(n,0)
  forget  P(n+1,0)
  for v in -1,1:
    compute P(n,v)
    forget P(n+1,v)

This would reduce the memory requirements a little, but not by a huge factor.
What if we consider two positions with values a,b:

  start with P(n+1,{0,+-1},{0,+-1})
  compute P(n,0,0)
  forget P(n+1,0,0)
  for a in -1,1:
    compute P(n,a,0)
    forget P(n+1,a,0)
    compute P(n,0,a)
    forget P(n+1,0,a)
  for a in -1,1:
    for b in -1,1:
      compute P(n,a,b)
      forget P(n,a,b)

Hmm.  I bet we can get close to a factor of 2, but it's probably hard to do
better.  Complicated though, and there's a much easier way to save a factor
of 2: use aggressive and passive modes.  Let's do it that way.
