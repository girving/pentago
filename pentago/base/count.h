// Symmetry-aware board counting via Polya's enumeration theorem
//
// We'd like to count boards without explicitly listing them all.  This is easy
// if symmetries are ignored: there are exactly choose(36,n)*choose(n,n//2) n
// stone boards.  With symmetries thrown in the results are more complicated,
// since different numbers of boards have different size orbits in the symmetry
// group.  Polya's enumeration theorem solves this with an elegant application
// of generating functions.
