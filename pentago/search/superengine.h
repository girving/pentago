// Core tree search engine abstracted over rotations
//
// The "superengine" is roughly a standard alpha-beta tree search engine, but operating on
// packs of 256 boards at a time (see superscore.h).  During any particular search, we pretend
// that one of the players wins ties, corresponding to an alpha-beta window of size 2 (similar
// to MTD(f)).  The player who loses ties is termed "aggressive".  For historical reasons, in
// some places we might accidentally call the aggressive player simply "black" and the other
// player "white", though the code now works with either player as the aggressor.
//
// In addition to the base functionality in base/superscore.h and base/symmetry.h, this file
// depends heavily on the symmetry-aware transposition tables in supertable.h.
//
// Starting from an empty board, this solver takes about 8.2 hours on a 2.3 GHz Macbook Pro
// to prove that pentago is a tie within the first 17 moves.
